Applications @ DWeb Camp 2019
=============================

The 2019 Decentralized Web ~Summit~ Camp will take place at a beautiful piece of coastal land an hour west of San Jose from July 18 to 21.
This area currently has very minimal network infrastructure and Internet connectivity.
One of the main features of the DWeb Camp will be a [local mesh network](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/meshnet).

A truly Decentralized Web would work in places where there is limited to no internet connectivity or restrictions due to cost or censorship.
The DWeb Camp is a perfect opportunity for us to make local messaging, mapping, websites, and file storage work with community-managed infrastructures in the wild, where we can all be builders and users of our decentralized technologies.
So we invite you to bring your ideas and skills to co-create these decentralized applications and processes that will run on our local network without guaranteed Internet connectivity.

This repository is currently a placeholder while we discuss best ways to facilitate this process.
We expect to publish details on how applications can be served over the meshnet and how project groups can organize by mid-April.
In the meantime, please hop onto the applications chat at [#dweb-camp-2019-apps:tomesh.net](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dweb-camp-2019-apps:matrix.org) to share your ideas and find collaborators to build decentralized tools at DWeb Camp!
